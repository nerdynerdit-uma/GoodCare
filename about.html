                <p class="lead-text">Good Care Home Health was founded on a simple belief: the best care is delivered with skill, compassion, and genuine respect for every individual. As a family-owned home health care provider serving clients throughout Southern California, we combine decades of clinical expertise with a deeply personal approach to care.</p>

                <p>At the heart of Good Care Home Health is its owner and clinical lead, a Registered Nurse with over 30 years of professional experience across a wide range of healthcare settings. After years of working within hospitals and clinical environments, it became clear that true healing often happens best at home—where patients feel safe, heard, and supported. That realization inspired the creation of Good Care Home Health.</p>

                <p>What began as a family-driven vision has grown into a trusted home health provider across Southern California, while remaining firmly rooted in the values of personal attention, integrity, and compassion.</p>
